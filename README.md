The URL for the site I mimicked is: https://www.apple.com/

The URL for the second page I mimicked is: https://www.apple.com/apple-events/

The URL for my fist layout (home) is: https://agitated-minsky-3b9047.netlify.app/

The URL for my second layout (events) is: https://agitated-minsky-3b9047.netlify.app/events.html

The URL for my third layout (contact Page) is: https://agitated-minsky-3b9047.netlify.app/contact.html

The 1st CSS component used is the BADGE component. I put it in the navagation bar next to the contact. It is the RED new badge.

The 2nd CSS component used is the BUTTON component. I used it on the home page on the lower 6 boxes. I manipulated it some with CSS to make it bigger and not look like a normal standard button.

The 1st JS component used is the CAROUSEL component on the home page. I included the controls so the viewer can choose which one to go to. 

The 2nd JS component used is the COLLAPSE component. I used it on the "Events" page. when you click on it the descriptions for the different events collapse and expand.
